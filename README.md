# What's Next!

Still a lot of work left to do on this project. 
<br>- In some spare time I'd like to add:<br>

    ☐ Styling of expired ingredients

	☐ Recipe API integration to give you some ideas to make with all that weird stuff in your pantry

	☐ even cleaner styling

	☐ promotion of the end product
